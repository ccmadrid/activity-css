    <p>A <em>BLT</em> (Bacon, Lettuce, and Tomato) is a type of bacon sandwich. The BLT evolved from the tea sandwiches served before 1900 at a similar time to the club sandwich, although it is unclear when the name BLT became the norm.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <img src="images/ingredients.jpg" alt="ingredients">
    <p>The standard BLT is made up of five ingredients:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Bacon</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Bread</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Although the ingredients of the BLT have existed for many years, there is little evidence of BLT sandwich recipes prior to 1900. In the 1903 Good Housekeeping Everyday Cook Book, a recipe for a club sandwich included bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise and a slice of turkey sandwiched between two slices of bread. Whilst the 1929 book Seven Hundred Sandwiches does include a section on bacon sandwiches, the recipes often include pickles and none contain tomato.</p>
<p>The BLT became popular after World War II because of the rapid expansion of supermarkets, which allowed ingredients to be available year-round. The initials, representing <em>bacon, lettuce, tomato"</em>, likely began in the American restaurant industry as shorthand for the sandwich, but it is unclear when this transferred to the public consciousness. For example, a 1951 edition of the Saturday Evening Post makes reference to the sandwich, although it does not use its initials, describing a scene in which:</p>
    
    <blockquote class="pquote">
    <p>"On the tray, invariably, are a bowl of soup, a toasted sandwich of bacon, lettuce and tomato, and a chocolate milk shake."</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>A 1954 issue of Modern Hospital contains a meal suggestion that includes: </p>
    
    <blockquote class="pquote">
    <p>"Bean Soup, Toasted Bacon Lettuce and Tomato Sandwich, Pickles, Jellied Banana Salad, Cream Dressing, and Pound Cake."</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>By 1958, Hellmann's Mayonnaise advertised their product as <em>traditional on bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwiches,</em> suggesting that the combination had been around for some time. However, there are several references to a <em>BLT</em> in the early 1970s, including in one review of Bruce Jay Friedman's play entitled Steambath titled: <em>A BLT for God â€“ hold the mayo.</em>. The abbreviation used in title references a line of dialogue in the play in which God yells,</p>
    <blockquote class="pquote">
    <p>"Send up a bacon and lettuce and tomato sandwich, hold the mayo. You burn the toast, I'll smite you down with my terrible swift sword."</p>
    </blockquote>
        
    <p>The coexistence of the shortened version and the full name suggests this was a period of transition as the abbreviation was popularized.</p>
